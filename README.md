##Description##
This script was made for as a portfolio project in the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer. All reviews and constructive criticism is welcome!

The purpose of this project was to create a function that would print a message with randomised components. In this case the message tells you what your spirit animal is, tells you where you get your strength and weakness from before finally giving you some poignant advice. I've thrown in a mix of serious and deep messages as well as some humourous and sarcastic ones. 

##Features##
With 4 randomised components and up to 80 items in some of the arrays it refers to, there is a total of 11,481,600 possible combinations. 

To give myself a challenge I added in a section that put either "a" or "an" in front of the animal type it gives you depending on whether the first letter of the animal is a vowel. 

I also split the serious and funny advice into two different array and gave the program a 75% chance of choosing from the serious array and 25% chance of choosing from the funny array. 

##Setup and Use##
